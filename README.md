## Birthday reminders

Receive an email notification for each birthday in your 'Birthdays' calendar. This script requires you to use Gmail and Google Calendar. If you are also using Google Contacts, you can [create a birthdays' calendar automatically](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6084659) from your contacts.

I run this script daily using a [time-driven trigger](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable#time-driven_triggers).
